//grab the user infomation from the survey
  //onclick
  //Using GET here to get the values

//Turn that information into an array
//Use a for loop to run the user choice against all of the people in the database
//each time in the for loop it will subtract the respective index
//the subtracted numbers will then be added and then pushed to an array ( maybe???)
//compare those numbers to each other and then get the lowest value
//use the lowest value to then say the are a perfect match
//then use a modal to pop up and show the lucky match dudes name and photoLink
//provide an exit to try the survey again for another match, or say no thanks you found the one
